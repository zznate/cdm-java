# Dataset Manager for Apache Cassandra

Dataset Manager for Apache Cassandra, referred to simply as `cdm`, is a tool to learn how to use Cassandra.

Work in progress.  Original cdm was written in Python but is being ported to Java for maintainability and the ability to easy distribute a single file.

## Building

You can build an executable via the following command:

`src/main/sh/build_runnable.sh`

This will create a JAR with a bash wrapper in the `bin` directory that you can drop in your $PATH and run like a normal Linux/Mac executable.  

CDM doesn't currently work on windows as it's dependent on bash and cqlsh.  There are plans to lift this restriction.

## Install a dataset 

Assuming you've put the `cdm` executable in your path, you should be able to run `cdm update` and see an updated list of datasets.  Run `cdm list` to see all the ones available.  `cdm install <name>` loads your data in your local cassandra cluster.  For instance, `cdm install movielens`.
